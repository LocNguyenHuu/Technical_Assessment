# Title: Fullstack Developer Assignment - Building a Task Management System

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to evaluate the candidate's technical skills and problem-solving abilities in fullstack development. The candidate will design and build a task management system that allows users to create, update, and track tasks. The system should have a user-friendly interface, robust backend functionality, and efficient data management.

## Requirements:


### Front-end Development:


Create a responsive and intuitive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or any frameworks (React, Vue, etc).

Implement a login and registration system for users.

Design a dashboard to display task lists and allow users to create, update, and delete tasks.

Add validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and user-friendly experience.


### Back-end Development:


Develop a RESTful API using a preferred backend framework (e.g., Express.js, Django, Flask).

Implement CRUD operations for tasks, users, and authentication.

Ensure proper error handling and validation of incoming requests.

Implement user authentication and authorization to secure the application.


### Database Management:


Design an appropriate database schema to store tasks and user information.

Select and implement a suitable database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).

Optimize the database structure and queries for efficient data retrieval and storage.


### Software Architecture:


Design the overall architecture of the application, considering scalability and maintainability.

Implement separation of concerns and modular code structure.

Use best practices for code organization and maintainability.


### Testing and Documentation:


Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure the functionality of the application.

Include clear instructions on how to run the tests.

Write detailed documentation, including setup instructions, API documentation, and any additional information necessary for the project.


## Acceptance Criteria:


The task management system must have a user-friendly interface with clear navigation and intuitive design.

Users should be able to register, log in, and log out of the system securely.

Users should be able to create, update, and delete tasks.

Tasks should be listed and displayed in an organized and visually appealing manner.

The system should handle errors and display meaningful error messages to the user.

The database schema should be well-designed and normalized to ensure data integrity.

The backend API should be properly documented and follow RESTful principles.

The code should be well-organized, modular, and follow best practices.

The unit tests should cover major functionalities and edge cases, ensuring robustness and correctness.

The Docker deployment process should be clearly documented and easy to follow.

## Submission Guidelines:

Provide a GitHub repository link containing the source code of your project.

Provide a demo video record on Google drive.

The submission should include separate folders for the front-end code, back-end code.

Provide a Dockerfile and clear instructions on how to deploy the application using Docker.

Include a detailed README file with setup instructions, API documentation, and any additional information.

Organize the code and documentation files in a well-structured and labeled manner.

## Evaluation Criteria:


Quality, functionality, and maintainability of the front-end and back-end code.

Comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the unit tests.

Correctness and efficiency of the Docker deployment process.

Clarity and thoroughness of the documentation provided.

Good luck with the assignment!
